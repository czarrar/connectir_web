# ROIs / Masks

This page will eventually contain various masks/ROIs and links to masks/ROIs. For now, I just have gray matter masks that you can download below.

## Gray Matter Masks

Below are different gray matter masks that you can download. Note that these are taken from the tissue priors (probabilistic masks) that come with [FSL](http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl).

1. [Unthresholded - 2mm mask](gray_raw_2mm.nii.gz)
2. [Threshold at 25% - 2mm mask](gray_thr25_2mm.nii.gz)
3. [Unthresholded - 4mm mask](gray_raw_4mm.nii.gz)
4. [Threshold at 25% - 4mm mask](gray_thr25_4mm.nii.gz)
