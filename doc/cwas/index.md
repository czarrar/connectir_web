# CWAS

There are 2 scripts to conduct Connectome-Wide Association Studies (CWAS): 

1. [connectir_subdist](/doc/cwas/subdist)
2. [connectir_mdmr](/doc/cwas/mdmr)

The [examples page](/doc/cwas/examples) contains how CWAS was conducted for each of the four analyses in our forthcoming paper and in our [poster at OHBM](/pub/hbm2011_cwas_poster.pdf).

If you find these scripts useful for your research, please consider citing our forthcoming paper:
