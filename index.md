Connectir is a R package that performs various data-driven analyses on fMRI data. Currently, its main function is the mapping of brain-behavior relationships across the entire functional connectome (i.e., all the possible functional connections in an individual's brain), which we term [Connectome-Wide Association Studies](/doc/cwas) or CWAS.
